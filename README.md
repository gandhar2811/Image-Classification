# Image-Classification
•	Developed an Image Classification Model which helps to identify an input image based on the dataset consisting of images collected from Bing Image Search API./n
•	Flattening and resizing processes were carried out, resulting in the normalization of image values.
•	Implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm along with GridSearchCV function to develop the classification model with 92% of accuracy.
